## The Burnt Caravan

### Scene Setup

After waking up in Stoneford the party hears a lot of noise outside. They see smoke still curling from the husk of a **merchant wagon**, half-burned and pulled off the road near the main gate. Several guards stand around, grim-faced, while a scribe takes notes. A few scavenger crows circle overhead.

### Details

- **Victims:** Three merchants (burned, charred remains) and two guards (dead with deep, _raking_ wounds). One mule survived, half-burned and restless.
- **Evidence:**
    - The wagon was torched with something hotter than oil fire — the wood has blistered, stone in the road is blackened.
    - The guards’ bodies have **claw marks** instead of weapon wounds.
    - A faint smell of **sulfur** lingers.
- **Witness:** A surviving boy (stablehand apprentice) hid in a ditch. He swears he saw **“a beast of shadow with burning eyes”** tearing into the guards before the fire consumed the wagon.
### What’s Really Happening

- The attack was staged by the **[[The Crimson Shroud]]** ([[Erysia|Erysian]] bandit faction). They used a **[[Summon Dragon]]** spell to destroy the caravan.
- Their motive: disrupt [[Stoneford]]’s supply lines, sow fear, and force merchants to rely on their “protected routes.”
### Hooks for PCs

- PCs can investigate the wreck → uncover bandit activity
- The guards may hire them to track down the culprits.
- If they follow the trail → they’ll find **signs of [[The Crimson Shroud]] scouts** watching the roads.


## Visiting [[The Silken Mirror]]



# Recap from the session
After waking up in Stoneford in [[The Bridgewater Inn]] the party spends around an hour shopping, [[Wurf Wuff]] bought a hair cut for 2 gp and [[Brother Bartholomew the Bottomless]] bought a complete outfit for 15 gp. 

[[Fenric Vardheim]] and [[Wurf Wuff]] then went to visit [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]] to try to gather information about a bandit guild starting in the city. Here they learn that the bandits call themselves [[The Crimson Shroud]]. They have just started expanding their operations to Stoneford. 

As [[Fenric Vardheim]] and [[Wurf Wuff]] were at [[The Warden’s Keep]], [[Brother Bartholomew the Bottomless]] and [[Alan]] see a mysterious person stalking them. They chase after the person and it leads them underneath the bridge. Here they see platforms underneath the whole bridge holding Stoneford up. 

The whole party meet when [[Brother Bartholomew the Bottomless]] and [[Alan]] rush to the south side of the bridge. Everyone except [[Fenric Vardheim]] rant to the south gate and climbed down to the platforms underneath Stoneford. [[Brother Bartholomew the Bottomless]] finish of the first [[Crimson Shroud Cutthroat]] before [[Alan]] and [[Wurf Wuff]] make it on to the platform. [[Fenric Vardheim]] on the other hand climbs down the side of the bridge and tries to swing himself towards the platform. He nearly grabs it before plummeting towards the ground. He manages to survive the 100 meter fall, before climbing up one of the poles holding the platform up. 

[[Fenric Vardheim]] get up to the platform before taking down two more [[Crimson Shroud Cutthroat]]. After both got taken down the rest of the party met up with [[Fenric Vardheim]]. They found three crates filled with dynamite before [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]] came and took over the cleanup of the crime scene.
