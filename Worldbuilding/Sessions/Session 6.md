## Attack on [[The Bridgewater Inn]]
In the middle of the night [[The Bridgewater Inn]] gets attacked. The player characters wake up to the tavern in chaos. They find [[Mayla Greenbrook]] on the floor gasping for air. 
> Please, give this to my daughter. 

She hands the players the key to the tavern before passing away. 
[[The Invisible Man| Dorrak]] walks down with the party to see the destruction. 

The party might see carved into the bar: "In silence we rule"
## Brothers vision
_Sleep draws you down again, but this time you don’t fall into darkness. Instead, you open your eyes upon a vast, quiet field beneath a starless sky. The ground is covered in pale white flowers, their petals swaying without wind. All is still, except for a soft glow in the distance — a single lantern’s flame._

_You walk toward it, each step strangely weightless, the flowers bending but never breaking beneath you. The silence is total until, at last, you hear the sound of wings — a white dove of ash circles above you, its feathers trailing like snow. It lands before you, and when it opens its beak, you hear a familiar voice._

> **Neryth (gentle, mournful):**  
> “You return to me in dreams. Even without seeking, you drift closer to my flame.”
> 
> “Do not fear. I would not bind you, not yet. I only wish you to see what I see… what I feel.”

_The lantern light swells, and the field changes. The flowers wither into grey ash. Shadows crawl across the ground, dragging chains. You hear faint cries — not of the living, but of souls, countless and restless. Some are guided upward toward faint stars… others are seized, yanked down into the darkness by unseen hands._

> **Neryth:**  
> “This is the truth of our sundering. Once, Kaelor and I were as one — he the keeper, I the guide. But now he hoards what should be free, and I… I am left powerless to comfort them.”
> 
> “Every cry, every wandering soul, I hear. They call to me. And I cannot reach them.”

_The ash dove flutters up again, circling you, its wings scattering embers. Neryth’s voice softens, more personal now._

> **Neryth:**  
> “You walked my grave. You read the words of betrayal. Perhaps it is chance… or perhaps the veil thinned for you alone. I do not yet know why fate has placed you here. But I feel your sorrow — and you feel mine.”
> 
> “Walk with me, dreamer. That is all I ask. Walk, and listen.”

_The lantern brightens again, filling the field with soft silver light. The chains recoil, the cries fade, and the flowers bloom once more. The vision begins to dissolve — and as you wake, you hear her final whisper, lingering like a memory of warmth:_

> **Neryth (fading):**  
> “Not yet, child… not yet. But soon.”

## Meeting with [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]]

When the PC's inform [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren|Hadrik]] about what has happened in the quarry he will be pleasantly surprised. He will explain to the PC's that they have been short staffed after having to send a patrol north. He explains that they're uncertain about what they will find there, but wanted to be on the safer side. This has left Stoneford less guarded than usual. The PC's help have been extremely well timed. He apologizes about his reaction under the bridge and asks the PC's for help yet again. 
## [[Owlbear]] attack south of [[Stoneford]]
A woman comes rushing into [[Stoneford]] screaming for help. She begs for help explaining that her farming community right south for [[Stoneford]] is being attacked by an [[Owlbear]].

If the players decide to help the community they will be rewarded with 20 gold and [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]] will thank them for their help recently. He might offer them an alliance of sorts where [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren|Hadrik]] can contact them if he ever needs their help.
