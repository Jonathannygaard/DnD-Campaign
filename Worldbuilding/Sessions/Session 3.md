## 1. **The Painted Hands**

- **Premise:** Overnight, strange **red handprints** have appeared on stone walls across Stoneford.
- **Complication:** No one has seen the culprit, but the stains don’t wash away, and people fear it’s a curse.
- **Twist:** The handprints were left by [[The Invisible Man]], who is desperately trying to lift the curse.
## Speaking to [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]]

### Scene setup
You enter [[The Warden’s Keep]] and are greeted by two guards. [[Sergeant Kaelen Duskrow]] and  [[Private Brunna “Bearcub” Ironfoot]]. 

> "Raisende!?! Hva bringer dere hit?" - [[Private Brunna “Bearcub” Ironfoot]]
> "Dere står ved Wardens keep, snakk deres sannhet.  Løgner varer ikke lenge her i Stoneford"- [[Sergeant Kaelen Duskrow]]


After speaking with them you may be lead to [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]] he will quickly recognize the clothes you're wearing and either be suspicious, but happy to see [[Fenric Vardheim]]. After a little conversation he will give you a ring that belonged to your mother. [[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]] got this after their death as no one was thought to be alive after the attack on your city. 

[[Warden Hadrik Dunwarren]] doesn't know anything about what attacked your village, but have heard rumors about another similar attack further north.

## The Disappearance in the Quarry

### Scene Setup

[[Stoneford]]’s eastern edge is dominated by a **large stone quarry**, where pale grey limestone is cut and shipped to build towns across the region. Recently, several quarry workers have **vanished without a trace**. The foreman insists it’s accidents, but the townsfolk whisper otherwise.

### Details

- **Missing Workers:** Four men and one woman gone in the past two weeks. No bodies, no tools found.
- **Odd Signs:**
    - A quarry pit has collapsed unusually, leaving a **jagged fissure** leading downward.
    - At night, workers claim they hear **scraping and whispering** from the depths.
    - Some tools have been found bent or broken, as though something immense had stepped on them.
- **Foreman’s Denial:** [[Garrick Flintmar]], the dwarven foreman, insists it’s “just bad luck” and wants the town to stay calm. He’ll be annoyed if the PCs pry, but secretly fears the truth.

### What’s Really Happening

- The quarry collapsed into an **old subterranean passage**, part of the [[Tunnels under Stoneford quarry|ancient tunnels tied to the banished gods.]]
	- You find a ring of runes, used under [[Banishment day]] to trap [[Neryth & Kaelor|Neryth]]
	- The power of [[Neryth & Kaelor|Neryth]] flowing through the tombs after the [[Summoning of The Ashen Harrower]], awakening the dead allowing them to walk the tunnels.
	- [[Undead Spirits]]
		- **DC Goal**: 16 to understand this is [[Neryth & Kaelor|Neryth]] using her powers to cast Summon undead.

### Hooks for PCs

- Families of the missing beg the PCs to investigate when guards refuse.
- PCs exploring the fissure can uncover remnants of old summoning circles, linking back to the **banished gods’ imprisonment**.
- Success could earn them Stoneford’s gratitude (or suspicion, if they delve too deep).
