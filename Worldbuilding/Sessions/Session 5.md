## Neryth's tomb
### **Traps in the Maze**

The tomb builders valued keeping intruders out more than fighting them directly.

- **Spear Wall Trap (mechanical):** A false door in a dead-end; opening it triggers spears shooting from the walls. (Dex save or 2d10 piercing).
- **Pit Trap:** A thin stone floor collapses into a 15 ft drop with skeletal remains at the bottom. (Dex save or fall, 1d6 damage)
- **Rune of Binding (magical):** Glows faintly on the floor. If stepped on, roots of shadowy necrotic energy restrain the victim until freed.

	- 1 HP
