### **Backstory**

- **Former Life:** Dorrak was once a **stonebreaker and hauler**, working in the [[Stoneford Quarry]]. His strength made him invaluable—he could lift blocks most needed a crane for. He was respected as a quiet, hardworking figure, though his size often intimidated others.
- **The Witch’s Curse:** On a business trip to Littlevale he got injured. Dorrak came to the potion maker after injuring his shoulder, hoping for a potion to restore his strength.
    - She offered him a “draught of resilience,” but when Dorrak drank it, it made him invisible.
    - She deliberately trapped him to test the effects of her concoctions on a hardy subject.

### **Current Situation**

- **Survival by Theft:** Dorrak doesn’t _want_ to steal, but food vendors chase away invisible beggars. He’s been sneaking bread, jerky, and occasionally coins from purses.
- **Bloody Hands Story:** After trying to steal some food from a storage building he got stabbed, by the owner the blood marks in [[Stoneford]] was made on his escape. 
- **Time Invisible:** Around **six months**. In that time, he’s grown ragged, desperate, and increasingly paranoid.
- **Why No One Believes Him:** Some townsfolk think the “invisible man” is just a ghost story. Others blame the bloody handprints on vandals or cultists. He’s been chased off whenever he’s tried to speak.

### **Personality**

- **Traits:** Gentle, desperate, wary. Loves to listen to people talk, because it reminds him he’s real.
- **Flaw:** His hunger and fear sometimes push him into risky thefts, making him look more like a criminal than a victim.
- **Ideal:** “If only I could be seen again, I’d never take the light of others for granted.”

### **Possible Hooks**

1. If they find him, they can decide to attack or hear him out. 
2. A choice: Do they help cure Dorrak, kill the witch or perhaps let him remain invisible but aid him in making a new life in the shadows?
