### **Appearance**

Thalen is tall, with pale lavender skin and curling silver horns polished to a mirror shine. His long black hair is braided with silver threads. He wears a perfectly tailored vest with faint glowing runes stitched into the lining. His shears — enchanted, silver-bladed scissors — hang at his hip like a knight’s sword.

### **Personality**

- **Charming & Theatrical:** He speaks as though every sentence is a line from a play. Even mundane phrases (“Pass me that spool”) sound like declarations.
- **Flirtatious:** He thrives on attention, complimenting clients lavishly, but it’s always in service of making them feel dazzling.
- **Loyal but Dramatic:** Admires [[Liora “Needles” Veyra]] fiercely, often exaggerating her brilliance in front of others: _“Ah, but only Lady Veyra could tame this fabric’s arrogance!”_
- **Precision Obsessive:** He cannot abide crooked seams, uneven hems, or waste of cloth. Perfection is his religion.


### **Abilities**

- His enchanted Silver Shears can cut through _anything_ — from steel chain to woven spell threads. He often uses them to snip away magical residue or curses that cling to garments.
- Can sculpt fabric magically: a gown may ripple like water, a cloak may billow without wind.
- Has proficiency in _Mage Hand_, which he uses to handle multiple fabrics at once while working.

### **Role in the Shop**

Thalen is the one who turns vision into form. He cuts fabric with impossible precision and constructs outfits that drape as though alive. While Liora sets the overall design, and Serenya crafts color and mood, Thalen ensures the creation is flawless in shape and line.

## **How They Interact**

- **Serenya & Thalen:** They clash often. Serenya favors flowing chaos and shifting illusions, while Thalen demands precision and form. Yet their rivalry makes the shop’s creations extraordinary — fabric that dances with living color but fits like a second skin.
    
- **With Liora:** Both view her as both mentor and queen, though each has their own ambition. Serenya seeks artistic legacy, Thalen craves perfection immortalized in noble courts. Liora balances them like an orchestra conductor, letting their eccentricities serve the artistry of _The Silken Mirror_.
