 - **Race:** Eladrin Elf (Autumn Aspect)  
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 120 (appears mid-20s by human standards)
- **Role:** Dye-mistress, illusionist, and color consultant

### **Appearance**

Serenya’s hair flows like liquid copper, shifting from auburn to gold depending on the light. Her skin has a faint shimmer, as though touched by autumn leaves at twilight. She wears flowing layered robes that never stain, even when she plunges her hands into vats of dye.

### **Personality**

- **Aesthetic Philosopher:** Serenya believes colors carry moods and destinies. She lectures about how a shade of green can open doors in court, or how scarlet inspires courage.
- **Graceful, but Unnerving:** Her movements are slow, deliberate, almost ritualistic — like she’s painting the air with every gesture.
- **Whispered Voice:** Speaks in a low, melodic tone that sometimes blends into background sounds, making her seem ethereal.
- **Hidden Mischief:** Loves enchanting fabric with temporary illusions to shock apprentices or amuse customers.

### **Abilities**

- Uses _Prestidigitation_ and _Minor Illusion_ to show clients how different dyes and fabrics will look before she commits them.
- Maintains vats of alchemical dye infused with moonlight, powdered gemstones, or faerie dust — her creations glow faintly or shift color subtly when worn.
- Sometimes her “dyes” seem to respond to emotion — a dress dyed in her care may deepen in hue when its wearer grows angry.

### **Role in the Shop**

Serenya prepares all exotic colorings, ensures enchanted fabrics keep their brilliance, and advises noble clients on the symbolic power of colors. She and Liora occasionally argue about practicality vs. spectacle, but both respect each other’s artistry.
