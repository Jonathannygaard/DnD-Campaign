### **Appearance**

- **Build:** Tall, broad-shouldered, carrying the weight of decades in the saddle and on the battlefield.
- **Face:** Weathered, sun-cracked skin; thick **grey beard**; one cheek scarred from an old axe wound.
- **Eyes:** Dark steel-grey, always scanning the horizon or the person before him for weaknesses.
- **Clothing/Armor:** Wears a **weathered breastplate** engraved with Stoneford’s crest (an anvil and river crossing). Keeps a heavy cloak of dark green wool fastened with an iron clasp.
- **Presence:** His stance is disciplined, military. Even when at rest, he carries the **aura of command**.

---

### **Personality**

- **Stern but Fair:** Rewards loyalty and diligence but punishes failure quickly. He doesn’t have patience for excuses.
- **Pragmatic:** Believes survival depends on discipline, strong walls, and clear chains of command — not lofty ideals.
- **Loyal to Stoneford First:** Suspicious of outsiders, and highly distrustful of [[Greymoor]], whom he considers “soft” and too political.
- **Fatherly Edge:** Though he doesn’t show it easily, he has a protective streak for the younger generation of Stoneford (including Brunna, who sees him as a role model).

---

### **History**

- **Military Past:** Fought in the frontier wars along the northern mountains. Served in the same campaigns as several veteran soldiers (possibly including a player character’s parent).
- **Rise to Power:** Was once a captain in Stoneford’s militia. Earned his rank after saving a river crossing against raiders, which gave him his scar.
- **Governorship:** Appointed warden after the last governor was ousted for corruption. Since then, Hadrik has ruled with a steady hand, balancing military law with the needs of the town.

---

### **Connections**

- **To the Player Character (Ranger Outpost survivor):** Knew their father personally, fought beside him in the mountains. Holds deep respect for their lineage and may gift them a keepsake (bearing the outpost’s **symbol**).
- **Kaelen Veymar (Guard):** Served under Hadrik in his youth — utterly loyal to him.
- **Brunna Coppervein (Guard):** Sees her as the “new blood” of Stoneford, whom he must shape into something harder than the world she imagines.
- **[[Greymoor]]:** Distrusts them — considers them political schemers who hide behind words instead of steel.

---

### **Role in the Story**

- **Anchor of Stability:** He’s one of the last leaders still rooted in _discipline over ambition_ — which makes him a stabilizing force, but also rigid and inflexible.
- **Moral Tension:** Players may see him as both a necessary ally and a frustrating obstacle — he’ll help them defend Stoneford, but he won’t easily support causes that don’t directly protect the town.
- **Potential Arc:**
    - If corrupted (say, by whispers of the Ashen Harrower or other threats), Stoneford could fall into zealotry.
    - If supported and inspired by the party, he could become a **key bulwark against the spreading cults**.

---

### **Quirks**

- Always sharpens his blade while speaking with visitors, as though reminding them of where power comes from.
- Dislikes wine or ale — drinks only water and boiled herbs, saying “a commander’s mind must be clear.”
- Collects old maps and keeps a locked chest with military relics from the frontier wars.
