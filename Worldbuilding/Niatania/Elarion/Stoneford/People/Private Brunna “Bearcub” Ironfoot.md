![[20250901_2327_Dwarf Guard in Training_simple_compose_01k43jr6g0feet9v7dmre6425e.png]]
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 68 (young for a dwarf)
- **Occupation:** Guard in training, assigned to the Warden’s Keep as her first major posting
- **Appearance:** Stocky with coppery hair pulled into two braids under her helmet. She wears armor slightly too big for her, making her look almost like a child in her father’s clothes. Carries a short spear and round wooden shield with Stoneford’s crest.
- **Personality:** Enthusiastic and talkative, often over-sharing with travelers. She wants desperately to prove herself but tends to ask too many questions and let her curiosity run wild.
- **Quirk:** Collects small carved wooden animals that she keeps on her belt as “good luck charms.”
- **Connection:** Idolizes Kaelen, shadowing his every move, though he finds her overeager nature exasperating. She is also the niece of a quarry foreman, tying her to Stoneford’s working class.

- **On First Meeting the Party:**  
    _“Oh! Outsiders! What brings you to the Warden’s hall? Not in trouble, are you?”_ (She blurts this out before Kaelen shushes her.)
- **Hooks:**
    - She asks a hundred questions — _“Where are you from? Have you fought monsters? Is it true elves never sleep?”_
    - She likes showing off her collection of little carved animals, often asking if the PCs have trinkets from their travels.
    - She gossips freely: _“I heard the quarry’s cursed — that’s why so many miners go missing. Kaelen says it’s hogwash, but I don’t know…”_
    - She might offer to fetch food or ale for the party while they wait to see the Warden, making her easy to befriend.
    - If befriended, she might later sneak the players into the Keep during a time of tension, risking Kaelen’s wrath.
