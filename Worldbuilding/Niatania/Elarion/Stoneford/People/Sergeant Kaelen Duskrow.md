![[20250901_2310_Half-Elf Senior Guard_simple_compose_01k43hrmpefmdb8nq59zkg9b1f.png]]
- **Race:** Half-Elf
- **Age:** 41
- **Occupation:** Senior Guard, watch leader at the Warden’s Keep
- **Appearance:** Tall and wiry, with sharp cheekbones and dark auburn hair tied in a short braid. His armor is well-kept but shows dents from years of use. Carries a halberd with a raven feather tied beneath the blade.
- **Personality:** Stern but fair, Kaelen has little patience for nonsense. He distrusts outsiders, especially after hearing whispers of Littlevale, but respects strength and honesty. Known for his piercing stare that seems to weigh a person’s soul.
- **Quirk:** Talks to his halberd as if it’s an old friend, muttering things like “Not today, old steel, not today.”
- **Connection:** Served under Warden Hadrik for nearly two decades. He reveres the Warden as both commander and father figure, and his loyalty is absolute.
- **On First Meeting the Party:**  
    _“You stand before the Warden’s Keep. State your business, and speak true — lies don’t last long in Stoneford.”_  
    (He’ll scan the group, making them feel weighed and judged.)
- **Hooks:**
    - If asked about Stoneford: _“Stoneford’s no place for the faint-hearted. Quarry runs deep, and so do the grudges.”_
    - He occasionally mentions past campaigns with Warden Hadrik — but never in full detail. Players might pry.
    - He can warn the party about trouble with bandits in the east: _“I’ve seen scouts from the Bladed Maw slinking closer. Mark me, they’ll test our walls before winter.”_
    - He distrusts anything magical. If spellcasters are in the party, he’ll mutter: _“Steel I trust. Magic… tends to bite the hand that wields it.”_
