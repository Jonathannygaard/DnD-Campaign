When entering:
> Welcome to The Silken Mirror! One of the great Atur's wonders here in Elarion!


- **Location:** Nestled on a side street of the merchant’s quarter, fronting a canal where colorful laundry lines stretch between buildings.
- **Exterior:** Painted in shimmering hues that change with the light, giving the impression of rippling silk. A carved wooden sign hangs overhead, depicting a mirror with threads draped across it.
- **Interior:**
    - **Front Room:** Gilded mirrors line the walls, enchanted to show clients in their _ideal_ self (some say a little too ideal, bordering on unnerving). Velvet curtains divide changing alcoves.
    - **Workroom:** Bolts of cloth — mundane and exotic — stacked high, some glowing faintly with enchantments. A dress form stands enchanted, sewing on its own under Liora’s command.
    - **Ambiance:** The air smells of lavender and warm linen. Faint harp music plays without any visible source.
    - **Security:** A pair of enchanted scissors floats behind the counter, snipping menacingly at anyone who touches fabric without permission.
