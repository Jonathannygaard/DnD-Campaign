- Appearance: A masked, half-skeletal figure with a wreath of roses and thorns, juggling glowing notes of sound. Its body flickers between carnival colors and shadow.
- Voice: Ever-changing — sometimes laughter, sometimes weeping, sometimes many voices overlapping like a crowd.
- Promise: _“Dance and you’ll never fear silence. Sing and you’ll never know despair. But all music ends — and when it ends, so do you.”_
- Quirks: Likes to play pranks on people.
