When first reading [[The Eclipsed Testament]] (Written in an ancient language, later evolved into celestial):

The ink shifts on the page, dark lines swimming like smoke. The room chills. The letters blur until you are no longer reading, but falling through them. You feel lantern light against your face — faint, flickering, like a star fighting against endless night.
_A woman’s voice, sorrowful and steady, threads into your mind:_

> “So… another dares to read the words of betrayal. Another mortal hand touches the knife that cut me from the Veil.”
> 
> “I am Neryth. I was the Shepherd of Souls, the gentle flame that guided the weary. Once, I carried every child of flesh into the stars. Now… I linger only as echo.”
> 
> “This book you hold is no scripture. It is a wound. A wound inked in chains and cowardice, by those who feared mercy more than death.”

_Her voice softens, like a mother to a child:_

> “I feel your heart. It beats heavy with sorrow. You have seen graves. You have touched loss. That is why I can reach you. That is why the veil parts.”
> 
> “Know this: what is bound may yet be unbound. One of the chains have already been broken. Who will be the one to break the next?”

_The lantern in her hand flickers, casting soft white fire that warms your skin. She lifts it toward you._

> “Will you bear my flame, child? Or will you leave me to fade into ash?”
