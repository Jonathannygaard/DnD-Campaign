**God & Goddess of the Afterlife**

- **Domains:** Death, Souls, Memory, Eternity, Judgement.
- Neryth is the **merciful guide** of souls, while Kaelor is the **merciless keeper** who hoards the dead in shadow.
- Together, they were once the guardians of balance — one to soothe, one to bind. When the gods were banished, their roles twisted.

##  Neryth, The Gentle Shepherd (Good)

- **Appearance:** A tall, robed figure of pale starlight, with flowing silver hair. Her eyes are pools of calm blue, and she carries a lantern that burns with a soft, eternal flame.
- **Personality:** Compassionate, endlessly patient, and sorrowful. She feels the suffering of every soul who passes into her care. 
- **Patron Shard:** _[[The Dove of Ashes]]_
    - A glowing white bird made of flame and feathers that fall like snow. It speaks in soft whispers, promising peace and release.
    - _“You have wandered long enough. Rest, child. Rest, and be remembered.”_

**Religion of Neryth:**
- Priests serve as undertakers, mourners, and comforters.
- Funerals are called **The Passing of the Lantern**, where a soul is symbolically carried by light into the Veil.
- Followers believe she leads the righteous into a field of stars beyond mortal sight.
- Viewed as the most merciful of gods, but also as unbearably distant — she feels sorrow for mortals, but cannot change their fate.

## ☠️ Kaelor, The Lord of Chains (Evil)

- **Appearance:** A gaunt, crowned figure clad in black iron, with chains wrapped around his arms and trailing endlessly behind him. His eyes glow red like dying embers.
- **Personality:** Stern, jealous, and uncompromising. He does not believe in mercy — only order, punishment, and eternal bonds.
- **Patron Shard:** _[[The Chainwraith]]_
    - A skeletal, hooded being with endless shackles dragging across the ground. Its voice is hollow, commanding, and full of cold inevitability.
    - _“No soul escapes. No life ends without my claim. All must be bound.”_

**Religion of Kaelor:**
- His priests are wardens of graveyards, crypts, and prisons.
- Followers see death not as peace, but as an eternal labor — chains of duty that never break.
- Some cults promise that those who serve Kaelor faithfully will wield power as undead guardians, continuing his work forever.
- Feared by common folk, but respected as inevitable.

## 🖤💔 Their Relationship

**Before the Banishment:**
- Neryth and Kaelor were inseparable, known as the **Veilbound Lovers**. Mortals prayed to both at funerals — Neryth to guide souls gently, Kaelor to ensure none were lost or stolen.
- Their love was quiet, strong, and eternal — the balance of mercy and order.

**During the Wars & Banishment:**
- When the gods were banished, Kaelor grew bitter and possessive, fearing the mortal dead would scatter into nothingness. He bound as many souls as he could, twisting them into wraiths, revenants, and other chained horrors.
- Neryth pleaded with him to release them, but he refused.
- Their love broke here: Neryth continued to guide, but her sorrow deepened, knowing Kaelor was stealing the peace of many.

**After the Banishment:**

- They are still bound — eternally married — but divided. Their realms of afterlife border one another, their voices still reaching across the Veil.
- When mortals die, some are claimed by Neryth, some by Kaelor, depending on deeds, fate, or sometimes sheer whim of divine balance.
- Followers of both say that in the deepest silence of night, you can hear them arguing across the planes: love and anger echoing endlessly.

## ⚖️ Mortal Views

- **Common Folk:** Most people pray to both, fearing Kaelor’s chains but hoping for Neryth’s light. To choose one over the other is considered dangerous.
- **Priests:** Funerals often include dual rites: a lantern lit for Neryth, and chains broken in Kaelor’s name (to appease him so he doesn’t bind the soul).
- **Cults:** Some cults worship only one — creating bitter divides. Kaelor’s cults promise strength in undeath, while Neryth’s promise eternal rest.

## ✨ Symbol

- **A Split Circle:** Half is a glowing lantern, half a chain.
- When carved or painted, it’s often shown cracked — representing their broken unity.

⚡ Adventure Hook Ideas:

1. A **soul tug-of-war** — a dying NPC’s soul is being pulled between Neryth and Kaelor. The players must intervene or choose who claims them.
2. A **Dove of Ashes** appears to one of the PCs in a dream, offering peace — but warns that Kaelor hunts their bloodline.
