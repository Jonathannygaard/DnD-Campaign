Far under the quarry down through old tunnels from [[Banishment day]] lie the circle. It's the banishment circle for [[Neryth & Kaelor|Neryth the goddess of the afterlife]].

### **Hidden Mechanism: The Soulbound Lock**

**How it works (overview):**  
The summoning circle and book aren’t just flavor — they’re part of the locking mechanism. The rest of the dungeon is sealed behind a heavy stone door that blends into the tomb wall. To open it, the players must interact with the circle in a specific way.

#### **The Puzzle/Mechanism**

- **Clue in the Book:** The book contains strange scribblings in Draconic/Necrotic/Elvish (whatever suits your setting). A successful **Investigation (DC 14)** or **Arcana (DC 12)** check reveals a passage:  
    _“The dead guard the path, but only those who offer life to the circle may pass.”_  
    This hints that the circle isn’t just decorative.
    
- **The Summoning Circle:** If a player touches or places something in the circle, faint runes glow. To fully activate it, they must offer _a piece of life force_:
    
    - Dropping **fresh blood** (from a wound, animal, or even undead ichor) will trigger a reaction.
    - A clever group might experiment with the undead they just fought (placing a corpse in the circle causes it to be absorbed into the stone).
- **The Door Mechanism:**  
    When the offering is correct, the runes flare brightly and pulse toward the wall. The faint outline of a stone door appears. The wall shudders and slowly slides down into the floor, revealing the way deeper into the tomb.

#### **Atmospheric Flavor**

When the mechanism works, describe it dramatically:  
_“The runes ignite with a sickly green glow, and the circle hums with power. The book’s pages flip on their own, landing on a blank sheet that burns with writing: ‘The way forward is opened.’ The stone wall rumbles, dust shaking loose as an archway yawns open into darkness.”_
