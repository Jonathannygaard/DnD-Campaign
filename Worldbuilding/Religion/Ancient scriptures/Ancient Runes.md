# **The Veilscript (Alphabet of the Ancient Tongue)**

### Design Philosophy

- Sharp, angular forms (like chains / cracks).
- Circles & dots inside letters (like lantern flames or souls).
- Horizontal strokes = “light” / divine.
- Vertical strokes = “chains” / binding.
- Easy to draw with pencil or marker.

### **Core Runes**

Here’s a basic “alphabet” (you don’t need one rune per English letter — just enough symbols for variety).

|Rune|Sound (approx.)|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|𐌂|**A / Ah**|Wide circle with a vertical stroke through it (like a chained soul).|
|𐌉|**E / Eh**|A triangle pointing upward, dot in the middle (lantern flame).|
|𐍂|**I / Ii**|Single vertical line with crossbar (like a tether).|
|𐍊|**O / Oh**|Circle with a line beneath (setting sun).|
|𐍆|**U / Uh**|Hook shape (like a sickle or broken chain).|
|𐌕|**K / Ka**|Harsh angled rune, looks like half a chain-link.|
|𐌗|**N / Neh**|Zig-zag, like lightning or fracture.|
|𐌙|**R / Ra**|Circle with trailing line (lantern swinging).|
|𐍀|**S / Sha**|Curved serpent shape.|
|𐌚|**Th / Thuun**|Circle with double vertical strokes — “bound flame.”|
|𐌛|**V / Vael**|Two mirrored hooks facing inward.|
|𐍂𐍂|**Double rune**|Sometimes doubled to show sacred/emphasized words.|

_(I’ve stylized these as “pseudo-runes,” inspired by old scripts but not real-world alphabets, so you can freely use them.)_

### Example Writing

If you wanted to write one of the earlier phrases (_“Vael’thuun mereth kaelorii, Neryth-haal’ven draesh”_), you’d mix these runes into a string. It would look jagged, alien, and repetitive — but consistent enough that your players might start “decoding” it if they get enough samples.

### Handout Trick

- Draw each rune large and bold, then surround it with faint circles, lines, and cracks (to make them look carved).
- For divine/ritual emphasis: put 3 dots (•••) under a rune.
- To creep them out: occasionally write the _same rune backward_ — suggesting corruption or inversion.

If you wanted to write _“Neryth guides the lost”_ in Veilscript, it could look like:  
**𐌗𐌉𐌙𐌉𐌚 𐌡𐍊𐍂𐌉𐌠𐌉𐍀 𐌕𐌢𐌉 𐌡𐍊𐍀𐌕**
