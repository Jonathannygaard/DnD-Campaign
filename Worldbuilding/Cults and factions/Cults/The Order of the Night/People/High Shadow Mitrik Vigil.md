- **Race:** Drow Elf
    - _Reasoning:_ Drow have natural connections to shadow, darkness, and the Underdark, making them perfect conduits for the Chain’s power.
- **Age:** **142 years old**
    
    - Elf's age slower than humans, so he’s still in his physical prime, though his mind carries decades of cunning and strategy. His long life also makes him a master manipulator, scholar of forbidden magics, and survivor of countless deadly plots.
- **Appearance:**
    - Pale, almost gray skin that seems to absorb light.
    - Silver-white hair falling to his shoulders.
    - Eyes like black mirrors, reflecting only darkness.
    - Always cloaked in flowing **shadow silk**, a material said to be woven with actual threads of the Underdark.
    - Wears a **black crystal mask** during all public appearances; his true face is rarely seen, rumored to cause despair in those who glimpse it.
- **Personality Traits:**
    
    - Fanatical yet calm; he believes his actions are righteous and necessary.
    - Highly strategic—he treats the Chain as both a weapon and a sacred artifact.
    - Charismatic and persuasive to cultists, yet terrifying to anyone who opposes him.
- **Abilities:**
    - Shadow manipulation: Can move through darkness, create shadowy tendrils, and summon shadow beasts.
    - Partial control over the Chain: Can extend its influence temporarily, summon creatures, or create areas of supernatural night.
    - Arcane knowledge: Expert in planar magic, divine suppression, and rituals that bind or weaken gods.
- **Motivation:**
    
    - Maelther believes the gods’ banishment was incomplete; their lingering influence still enslaves mortals in subtle ways. By fully harnessing the Chain, he aims to **eradicate divine interference permanently**, making mortals masters of their own destiny—or under his dominion if they resist.
