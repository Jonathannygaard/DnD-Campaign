The Order of the Night is a Cult originated in [[Drekhmir]]. They have begun terrorizing the northern part of Elarion. 


## **The Order of the Night – Overview**

- **Origin:** A shadowy cult originating from the remote island [[Drekhmir]], a volcanic island perpetually shrouded in twilight.
- **Philosophy:** They believe mortals are mere pawns, and the gods’ absence should remain permanent. To them, the Chain is a tool of liberation—they want to bind any remnants of divine influence permanently.
- **Current Objective:** Use the Chain to assert dominance over the northern cities and prepare for a ritual to expand its power, potentially creating a **divine-null zone** across the entire region.

## **Effects on the Northern Cities**

1. **Eternal Night:** Cities under the Chain’s influence experience a supernatural night—sunlight is blocked, shadows deepen unnaturally, and nocturnal creatures grow bold.
2. **Divine Weakening:** Priests and paladins lose some of their divine magic. Healing and protective spells are less effective, and some divine wards fail entirely.
3. **Civil Unrest:** Citizens panic. Merchants, guards, and nobles are torn between fighting, fleeing, or bending to the cult.
4. **Creatures of Darkness Rise:** Shadow beasts, undead, and other creatures drawn to the Chain’s influence become more common, giving the cult minions to terrorize the population.

## **Plot Hooks for the Players**

1. **Initial Encounter:** The players see a northern city under siege by shadow beasts. Survivors whisper about the Order and the "Chain that blocks the gods."
2. **Mystery and Investigation:** Clues lead to rumors of a floating black chain appearing in moonlight. Villagers speak of strange whispers and a shadow stretching across the city.
3. **Confrontation with Cultists:** Early encounters could involve stopping smaller operations of the Order, rescuing key figures, or defending temples under siege.
4. **The Chain’s Influence on the Players:**
    - Divine magic begins to fail unpredictably near the Chain.
    - Shadowy hallucinations or visions attempt to sway the party.
    - A curse could attach to players who approach the Chain directly, giving temporary powers at a cost (morally or physically).
5. **Race Against Time:** The Order plans a ritual at the **Winter Solstice**, which would permanently extend the Chain’s influence over the entire north. The players must gather allies, locate ways to counteract the Chain, or find artifacts to challenge the cult.
6. **Moral Dilemma:** The Order’s philosophy could appeal to some NPCs—do the gods truly deserve influence over mortals? The players may face choices about destroying, seizing, or even temporarily wielding the Chain.

- **Frozen Forest Outskirts:** The players can track the cult to prepare a counterattack.
    
- **High Cliffs Overlooking the Sea:** The Order’s landing from the Isle of Dusk; a naval pursuit could be epic.
