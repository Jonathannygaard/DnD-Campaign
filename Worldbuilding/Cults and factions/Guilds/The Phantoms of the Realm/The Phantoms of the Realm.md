**The Phantoms of the Realm** are the _invisible hand_ of the Havenswift dynasty — a clandestine guild of assassins, spies, and rogues that serve the crown under the guise of maintaining peace, stability, and secrecy.  
Officially, they **don’t exist.** Unofficially, every noble and guildmaster in the kingdom knows better than to cross the king’s brother, **[[Liander Havenswift]]**, their shadowy leader.


# Origin and History
- **Purpose:** Originally formed as a _loyalty network_ and _assassin’s guild_ to eliminate threats to the royal bloodline — both foreign and domestic.
- **Evolution:** Over generations, the Phantoms became a permanent fixture in the kingdom’s underbelly — part intelligence agency, part criminal syndicate, part secret police.
- **Symbol:** A silver mask half-covered in shadow, often worn by senior members. The guild motto:
> “In silence, we rule.”

# Structure

## Leadership

### [[Liander Havenswift]] - The Shadow Regent
- **Title:** Master Phantom
- **Personality:** Calm, calculating, and charismatic. Speaks rarely but decisively.
- **Motivation:** Believes that the stability of the kingdom justifies any act, no matter how cruel. He sees himself as the _necessary darkness_ that protects the light of his brother’s reign.
- **Conflict:** Some whisper he enjoys ruling more than serving. Others say he’s begun to question whether his brother deserves the throne at all.

### **Council of Masks**

[[Liander Havenswift]] oversees a secret council of seven high-ranking operatives known as the **Masked Hands**, each representing a key function:

1. **The Whisper** – Master of intelligence and informants.
2. **The Dagger** – Oversees assassinations and covert eliminations.
3. **The Shade** – Handles infiltration, burglary, and counter-espionage.
4. **The Veil** – Controls misinformation, blackmail, and propaganda.
5. **The Spider** – Manages networks within the criminal underworld.
6. **The Wraith** – Responsible for magical secrecy and illusion-based espionage.
7. **The Coin** – Financier and handler of bribery, corruption, and “donations.”

Each wears a distinct silver mask engraved with their title’s symbol.

## Headquarters

**The Masked Hands** meet when summoned deep under the castle in the dungeons and tunnels. Most of the tunnels are not in use so The Phantoms of the Realm take advantage of them.
