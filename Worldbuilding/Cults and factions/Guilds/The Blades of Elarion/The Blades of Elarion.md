### **Guild Culture & Traditions**

- **The Oath of the Blade:** Every recruit must swear loyalty to the Havenswift crown and the Warrior’s Guild. Breaking this oath is considered treason.
- **Trial by Steel:** Before becoming a full member, initiates must endure a brutal combat trial, proving their skill, endurance, and courage.
- **The Feast of Fallen Blades:** Once a year, they hold a great feast to honor those who died in service. Stories of the fallen are told, ensuring their memory lives on.
- **Personal Honor:** While orcs and half-orcs are often stereotyped as brutish, Zars has shaped the guild to value discipline and restraint—warriors are expected to protect, not oppress.

### **Influence & Political Standing**

- The Warrior’s Guild is immensely powerful due to their control of the army.
- Many nobles both **fear** and **respect** [[Zars Ironhide|Zars]], since his loyalty keeps the throne secure, but his influence could threaten the [[Havenswift|Havenswifts]] if ever turned.
- Other guilds may see them as blunt instruments, but also indispensable.

### **Relations with Other Guilds**

- **[[Keepers of the Arcane]]:** Sometimes tense. Warriors see mages as overly arrogant; mages see warriors as short-sighted. However, they cooperate in wartime.
- **Merchant’s Guild:** Cooperative but transactional—the warriors protect trade routes, and merchants fund equipment and supplies.
