# **Archkeeper Ivira Desjardins**

**Race:** Half-Elf, Half-Fey (fairy lineage)  
**Age:** 74 (appears mid-20s in human years; her mixed blood slows aging)  
**Gender:** Female  
**Title:** Archkeeper of the Arcane, First Voice of the Circle, Guardian of the Vaults  
**Alignment:** Neutral Good  
**Specialty:** Transmutation and Fey Magic (blending arcane with the natural, living world)

---

### **Appearance**

- Slender, graceful, with an aura that seems to shimmer faintly under moonlight.
- Her hair is a cascade of silver and pale green strands, always shifting slightly as if caught in a breeze that others can’t feel.
- Her eyes are a striking violet, flecked with golden motes that glow faintly when she channels magic.
- Typically wears layered academic robes embroidered with silver runes — practical yet regal. She forgoes a crown, instead carrying an ornate staff of living wood that sprouts blossoms when she casts.

---

### **Personality**

- **Visionary & Idealistic**: She deeply believes magic should be shared and not hoarded by elites. Her dream is to make the Tower more open to the common people than ever before.
- **Calm but Unyielding**: Speaks softly, but with conviction. Her opponents often underestimate her until they realize she’s impossible to sway from her principles.
- **Diplomatic**: Listens intently, gives others the sense they’re heard. She smooths tensions both within the Circle and at the royal court.
- **Haunted by Pressure**: Being the youngest Archkeeper, she constantly feels the need to prove she’s worthy of the role. She pushes herself harder than anyone else, sometimes to exhaustion.

---

### **Background**

- Born to a human noble’s elven descendant and a fey wanderer who passed briefly into the material realm. Her heritage made her an outcast in her youth — too strange for elves, too grounded for fey, too magical for humans.
- Discovered her gifts early when she accidentally turned a bully’s sword into flowers. The Keepers took her in as a child prodigy.
- Rose quickly as a brilliant scholar of **transmutation, natural magic, and planar studies**, bridging arcane theory with primal, fey knowledge.
- When the previous Archkeeper died suddenly (perhaps of old age, or mysteriously?), Ivira was nominated against tradition. Many opposed her, but her election passed — partly because she represented a new era for the Keepers.

---

### **Role as Archkeeper**

- **Champion of the Common Folk**: Has opened more sections of the Great Library to the public than any Archkeeper before her.
- **Mediator**: Her unique heritage makes her skilled at balancing opposing views — between Circle members, guilds, or even crown vs. people.
- **Innovator**: Encourages magical experimentation and interdisciplinary studies — she wants to push the boundaries of magic for the good of all.
- **Keeper of Secrets**: Though idealistic, she respects the duty of hiding dangerous relics, often visiting the Vaults personally. She believes transparency must be balanced with responsibility.

---

### **Strengths**

- Natural charisma and magical presence — people feel calm around her.
- Incredibly gifted in combining traditional arcane with fey enchantments, creating new magical techniques.
- Sees the bigger picture, not just the short-term gain.

### **Weaknesses**

- Inexperience compared to older members of the Circle — can be manipulated in [[politics]] if she isn’t careful.
- Idealism sometimes blinds her to harsh realities.
- Her fey blood makes her emotions strong; when pushed too far, her calm demeanor can shatter into sudden wrath.

### **How Others See Her**

- **The King/Queen**: [[Prince Williame Havenswift]] believes [[Ivira Desjardins]] is too young to be Archkeeper. [[Princess Seloue Havenswift]] is one of her closest friends.  
- **The Circle of Nine**: Divided — some see her as the future, others resent being led by someone so young and “otherworldly.”
- **The People**: Adore her. To commoners, she is the first Archkeeper who truly seems approachable, walking among them and listening to their concerns.
