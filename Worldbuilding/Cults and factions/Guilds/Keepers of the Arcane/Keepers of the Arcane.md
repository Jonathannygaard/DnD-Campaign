# **Origins & History**

- Founded centuries ago during a period of magical upheaval. 
- The first Keepers swore an oath to **never let arcane power be misused** — by kings, by commoners, or by themselves.
- Helped during [[Banishment day]]
- Over time, their influence grew as the ruling Havenswift monarchs realized the value of a dedicated magical council.

# **Structure**

- **The Archkeeper** ([[Ivira Desjardins]]): The elected leader of the guild, serving as advisor to the king. Traditionally chosen every 12 years by consensus among the senior members.
- **The Circle of Nine**: The most senior wizards, each specializing in a different school of magic (e.g., Keeper of Divination, Keeper of Evocation, Keeper of Abjuration, etc.).
- **Lorewardens**: Mid-ranking members, scholars and field wizards who both research and aid in practical affairs.
- **Apprentices/Initiates**: Students training in magical arts under the supervision of the Lorewardens.

# **Roles in the Kingdom**

- **Advisors to the Crown**: They sit in the royal court when arcane matters are discussed. They might warn against cursed artifacts, help defend the realm with wards, or advise on magical diplomacy.
- **Guardians of Knowledge**: The Keepers maintain the **Sanctum Arcanum**, a vast magical library containing spells, histories, and forbidden tomes locked away for safekeeping.
- **Defenders of the Realm**: In times of war, they provide magical defenses (wards over cities, enchanted siege weapons, teleportation circles for supply lines).
- **Protectors Against Magical Threats**: They investigate magical anomalies, rogue spellcasters, or extraplanar incursions.

# **Philosophy & Values**

- **Balance of Power**: They believe magic is a gift meant to uplift, not dominate.
- **Stewardship of Knowledge**: Knowledge belongs to all, but dangerous secrets must be handled responsibly.
- **Service Before Self**: Members are sworn to serve the kingdom and its people before personal ambition.
- **The Oath of the Keepers**: A sacred promise each member takes upon initiation — "To guard, to guide, to preserve, and never to corrupt."

# **Headquarters**

- **[[The Tower of the Veil]]**: A grand, many-spired tower in the capital, shimmering with protective wards. It houses the guild’s chambers, archives, and training halls. Its outer layers are public (like a university), but its deepest chambers are sealed for only trusted members.

# **Political Role**

- Loyal to the Havenswift line — but they act as **guardrails**, quietly preventing rulers from making reckless magical choices.
- Respected by the other guilds, though sometimes viewed as aloof or overly cautious.
- Have a history of stepping in during times of magical crisis — sometimes against the wishes of the monarch, but always in defense of the people.
