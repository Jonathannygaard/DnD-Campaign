- Located in the capital, it is both **university and guild hall**.
- The outer halls are open: lecture halls, study rooms, magical gardens, and the **[[The Great Library of Erysia|Great Library]]**.
- Deeper within lies the **Council Chamber** (where the Circle meets), research labs, and magical vaults where dangerous relics are stored.
- Beneath the tower: **[[The Arcane Vaults]]**, sealed with wards that require multiple Keepers to unlock.
# **The Tower of the Veil**

_"A beacon of knowledge to the people, a fortress of secrets to those who would misuse magic."_

### **Exterior Appearance**

- The Tower rises above the capital’s skyline, a **spiraling structure of pale stone shot through with veins of silver and crystal**. It glows faintly under moonlight, as if the stone itself remembers the stars.
- Nine distinct spires crown the top — each representing a Keeper of the Circle, their tips enchanted to shimmer in a different hue of magical light (schools of magic colors).
- Its base is encircled by a wide plaza where students, scholars, and common folk gather. Magical lanterns float above the square, always giving a sense of day even in the darkest night.  
- Protective wards are woven into the walls, making them impervious to siege engines, fire, or casual teleportation. When the Tower feels threatened, its silver veins blaze with light, and magical shields ripple into existence.

### **Interior Design**

The Tower is **layered like a spiral**, with different sections dedicated to public, scholarly, and restricted functions.

#### **1. The Outer Halls (Public Access)**

- Open to all citizens of the kingdom.
- Includes lecture halls, classrooms, libraries of common knowledge, botanical gardens with magical plants, and the **Hall of Questions**, where petitioners can ask questions of students or Lorewardens.
- The atmosphere here is warm, bustling, and filled with the hum of magical experiments and debate.

#### **2. The Great Library (Scholar’s Wing)**

- A vast hall with shelves spiraling upward into the tower’s height, enchanted ladders floating to fetch books.
- Open to students, scholars, and approved visitors.
- Divided into sections: **Arcane Theory, Magical History, Practical Casting, Magical Creatures, Planar Studies, and Forbidden Knowledge (sealed wing).**
- The **Index Guardian**, a sentient construct (perhaps a golem of ink and parchment), manages the catalog and directs readers.

#### **3. The Council Chambers**

- Midway up the tower, in a circular chamber beneath a domed ceiling of shifting constellations.
- Here the Archkeeper and the Circle of Nine meet. Each seat has enchantments amplifying the speaker’s voice.
- The Archkeeper’s seat rests slightly elevated, but Ivira deliberately keeps her staff at her side rather than a throne to symbolize humility.

#### **4. Laboratories and Practice Halls**

- Upper levels house classrooms and magically shielded chambers for testing spells, duels, and experiments.
- The walls in these chambers absorb magical energy, preventing accidents from spreading destruction through the tower.

#### **5. The Private Quarters**

- Residences for senior members, apprentices’ dormitories, and guest chambers for visiting scholars or envoys.
- Enchanted windows give views of the stars, no matter the weather outside.

#### **6. The Arcane Vaults (Restricted)**

- Hidden deep below the tower, accessible only by multiple Circle members using keys of thought, word, and power combined.
- Guarded by **perpetual arcane wards** and creatures bound from other planes.
- Here lie cursed artifacts, dangerous spellbooks, and unstable relics too perilous for common study.
- Few initiates ever glimpse this place; even most Lorewardens are barred.

### **Magical Operations & Wards**

- **Living Stone**: The tower repairs itself slowly when damaged.
- **The Veil**: A constant magical shroud prevents scrying or divination from outside forces.
- **The Binding Seal**: No member may draw a weapon or cast an offensive spell within the Council Chambers; such attempts fizzle out.
- **The Memory Echoes**: The tower itself “remembers” — when one walks its halls, faint echoes of great events and voices of the past sometimes replay, like magical imprints.
- **Teleportation Anchors**: The tower is a hub of teleportation, with permanent circles linking it to other major cities, but only the Keepers can activate them.

---

### **Daily Life in the Tower**

- **Morning Bells**: At dawn, enchanted chimes call students and Lorewardens to lectures.
- **Open Hours**: Common folk come to the Outer Halls to read, ask questions, or seek magical aid.
- **Council Sessions**: Held weekly unless an emergency arises.
- **Ritual of the Veil**: At nightfall, the Circle performs a quiet ritual renewing the wards of the tower.

### **Reputation Among the People**

- To the commoners, the Tower is both **a place of wonder and reassurance** — they know that the kingdom’s greatest minds work to keep magic safe.
- To nobles, it is **a rival seat of influence**, though cloaked in scholarship rather than [[politics]].
- To apprentices, it is **a dream realized** — a chance to learn what few ever glimpse.
